-- Requirement: Customer Payments Summary Table
-- The client requested a summary table that showcases key customer-level insights for demo purposes. The goal was to present a simplified use case that highlights DBTâ€™s transformation capabilities using modular SQL logic and CTEs.

-- Specifically, the client wanted:
-- ->A table listing each customer
-- ->The total payments made by each customer
-- ->The date of their first order
-- ->The date of their most recent order
-- ->To achieve this, we pulled data from the staging layer (stg_customers, stg_orders, stg_payments) and applied transformations in the data mart layer using CTEs for clarity and easier debugging.
